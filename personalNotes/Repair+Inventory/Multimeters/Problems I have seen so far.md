- Init freeze:
	- Sometimes this fixes itself
	- U103 Seems to be part of the problem of a frozen init
		- Not exactly sure why but removal sometimes fixes init problem
	- Solutions:
		- connect to usb and try different commands (does not work)
		- turn on and off rapidly >4 times (does not work)
- Fuse Holder broken
	- Solutions:
		- Plastic welding 
			- plastic to thin and small. Not viable
		- Replacement
	- notes:
		- Apparently Ron had a specific tool for this purpose
- Instability of measurement
	- Solutions:
		- TBD
- No init and periodic noise (nothing on screen)
	- Observed:
		- U127 overheating (ALSO RON OBSERVED THIS)
			- https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/bk-precision-2831e-input-resistor-repair/
			- Could be C186 (near display cable)
		- an oscillator or relay at low frequency (e.g. <100Hz) 
			- Most likely a relay
	- Solution:
		- TBD
- Short on VCC and ground on u116
	- Currently investigating
- Mystery Short on u118 pin found
	- Caused u127 to heat up
	- Solved by removing components and introducing voltage to burn the short
