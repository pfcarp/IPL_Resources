- relay k101:
	- responsible for the switching between high and low voltage ranges 
- u127
- Key for the Zero Cal operation is `6666`
- Most of the time the capacitor near the display (C186) connector shorts out
- U103 Seems to be in charge of the low-level functionality (i.e relays) and partially responsible for init process
