- R2 burning up
- No display
- Wont turn on after switching off


- I have a suspicion that the u1 voltage regulator is in a failure mode that I have never encountered. the reason being when replaced when another 5v voltage regulator (that is not the same as the 7805ctb) the power on and off behaves as expected 
	- Is it due to some leakage current pulling down the voltage of the whole circuit which in turn makes U2 (and by proxy Q1) behave erratically?
	- is the problem really with U1?
		- Is it worth investing more of my time to investigate the problem or should I just slap another voltage regulator and call it a day
			- Is it worth talking to my superiors about this???
